            ## Marijuana Recomender

            Marijuana can help treat a multitude of diffrent ailments, but one of the harder questions is 
            what strain is right for you. Do you want the train that helps you be more creative and able to focus, the one 
            that is supposed to calm you down and make you less anxious, or a certain mix of both. 
            
            This app was made to help answer these
            questions in a meaningful and usable way. It is simple to use and can give a recommendation backed
            by data on what the user should buy for their personal treatment.
